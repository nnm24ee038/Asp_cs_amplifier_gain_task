# **Submission Guidelines**

Everyone must submit their LTspice schematic files using the correct naming format:

### **Required Filename Format**

```
USN_Name.asc
```

**USN** – Your University Seat Number
**Name** – Your full name
**.asc** – LTspice schematic file extension

### **Example**

```
NNM24EE0xx_YourName.asc
```

### **Rules**

* Only `.asc` files are accepted.
* Filenames **must** follow the format exactly.
* One file per person.

### **Purpose**

A standard naming convention keeps the repository organized and prevents files from overwriting each other during batch submissions.
